## About

Also serves as Full Stack Open 2020 ([MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/) by University of Helsinki) personal final project. For that reason a working hours' tracking document is included in the repository under [school/](https://github.com/jalho/j3.re/blob/master/school/Ty√∂aikakirjanpito.md).

    <details>
      <summary>Motivation</summary>

      Full Stack Open 2020, popularity and the fact that it's the only one I know at the time of writing.

    </details>

* React component library: **React Bootstrap**
  * Documentation: [react-bootstrap.github.io](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
    <details>
      <summary>Motivation</summary>

      Popularity, age (battle tested), mobile friendliness. Use of *Sass* (as of version 4).
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Motivation</summary>

      More similarity to previous languages I've programmed with (Java and C) when compared to the other option, JavaScript. Enforced typing supports my desire of documenting well.
    </details>

  * Documentation: [vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
    <details>
      <summary>Motivation</summary>

      Exposure, a friend uses it in his projects. Nothing more to it really, just had to pick one.
    </details>
* Domain name registrar: **EuroDNS**
  * Website: [eurodns.com](https://www.eurodns.com/)
    <details>
      <summary>Motivation</summary>

      The first one I came across on AFNIC's (the registry in charge of my desired `.re` top level domain) listing that had their site available in English. The company and their service didn't seem suspicious, and they kindly made my special case `j3.re` available upon my request via email, as initially their (and many other registrars' I checked) search didn't support the edge case 2 character domains like mine, that I still knew was technically allowed with `.re` as long as there's one letter and one number.
