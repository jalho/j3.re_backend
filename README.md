## Scripts

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

* `npm start dev`

    *Run `src/index.ts` in continuous watch & restart mode using nodemon and ts-node. This is the only script needed in development.*

* `npm start`

    *Run `build/index.js` (compiled from TypeScript) with Node.js. Heroku web process is configured (in `Procfile`) to use this script. It does so after automatically running the build script too.*

* `npm run build`

    *Run `tsc`, i. e. compile TypeScript as configured in `tsconfig.js`. Output to `build` directory. Heroku uses this script automatically on deploy.*
