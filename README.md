# About

Jere Alho, [@jalho](https://github.com/jalho) on GitHub

This is the source of my personal website to be served at [j3.re](http://j3.re/).

Also serves as Full Stack Open 2020 ([MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/) by University of Helsinki) personal final project. For that reason a working hours' tracking document is included in the repository under [temp/school](https://github.com/jalho/j3.re/blob/master/temp/school/Työaikakirjanpito.md).
